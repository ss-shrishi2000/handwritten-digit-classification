# Handwritten-Digit-Classification Using KNN Algorithm
The repo comprises of my undertaken project under the Winter Mentorship sessions of UAceIt, 2022. 

## Libraries Used For Project Implementation 
 1. Numpy
 2. Pandas 
 3. Matplotlib

## Built Using Google Collab
## KNN Algorithm 
<div align = 'left'>
 
K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a type of supervised ML algorithm which can be used for both classification as well as regression predictive problems. However, it is mainly used for classification predictive problems in industry. The following two properties define KNN well −
 <h3 align = 'left' > 1. Lazy learning algorithm  </h3> KNN is a lazy learning algorithm because it does not have a specialized training phase and uses all the data for training while classification. </br> 
 <h3 align = 'left' > 2. Non-parametric learning algorithm </h3> KNN is also a non-parametric learning algorithm because it doesn’t assume anything about the underlying data.
